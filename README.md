# Installation

For installing simple scalar on ubuntu just need to run this simple script provided on this [GitHub](https://github.com/sdenel/How-to-install-SimpleScalar-on-Ubuntu/blob/master/install_simple_scalar.sh)

# Running

For running the code we have used this cmd,

```
./sim-bpred -bpred 2lev tests/bin.little/anagram
```

Instead of 2lev there are 5 default options

1. nottaken
2. taken
3. bimod
4. 2lev
5. comb

For the other 3 strategies we implemented, 

1. hash01 - strategy 06
2. hashsign - strategy 07
3. hashsms - novel strategy
